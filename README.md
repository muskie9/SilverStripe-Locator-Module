Overview
=================================

 The Locator module displays a searchable map of locations. You can choose whether to show all locations on load, or enable auto geocoding to filter the initial list based on the visitor's location. 

Composer Installation
=================================

`"require": { "dynamic/silverstripe-locator": "dev-master }`

Add `locator` and `addressable` to your `.gitignore`

Git Installation
=================================

`git clone git@github.com:dynamic/SilverStripe-Locator-Module.git locator`

`git clone git@github.com:silverstripe-australia/silverstripe-addressable.git addressable`

`rm -rf .git` (optional, to remove existing git repo)

Requirements
=================================

 *  SilverStripe 3.1.x
 *  Addressable Module by silverstripe-australia for Location geocoding - https://github.com/silverstripe-australia/silverstripe-addressable
 
Use
=================================

 Create a Locator page in the CMS. Locations are managed under the Locations tab in the CMS via Model Admin. Simply enter the name and address of each location, and they will appear on the map.

 ~~To customise locations with custom fields, do as you normally would using a DataExtension. Then copy LocationXML.ss, infowindow-description.html and location-list-description.html into your theme's template folder.
 You can add new fields from the DataExtension to the LocationXML.ss to access them in the two .html templates. (i.e. `<marker newField="$newField.XML">` and in the html templates `{{newField}}`)~~
